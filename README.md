# LPSGM: A Unified Flexible Large Polysomnography Model for Sleep Staging and Screening of Sleep Disorders and Depression

## Overview

![overview](figures/graphical_abstract.png)

**Figure 1**: Overview of the LPSGM framework. Panel (a): Data harmonization schematizes the aggregation of 220,500 hours of PSG data from 16 public datasets and 2 independent clinical cohorts, spanning diverse geographic populations and recording protocols. Panel (b): Cross-center generalization outlines the training-evaluation pipeline: LPSGM is pre-trained on multi-center public datasets, validated for cross-domain sleep staging on two unseen private datasets, and fine-tuned for downstream screening tasks covering narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. Panel (c): Analytical validation details the study's three-pronged evaluation: (1) a prospective clinical trial benchmarking LPSGM against expert consensus, (2) interpretability analysis to decode decision-making patterns, and (3) ablation studies quantifying the contribution of key components.

## Architecture

![architecture](figures/model_architecture.png)

**Figure 2**: Overall architecture of LPSGM. (a) LPSGM consists of an Epoch Encoder, Sequence Encoder, and Classifier, designed for both sleep staging and disorder screening. (b) The Epoch Encoder employs a dual-branch CNN to extract local intra-epoch features from each 30-second PSG segment, using small and large convolutional filters to capture high- and low-frequency EEG features, respectively. (c) The Sequence Encoder consists of a series of N Transformer blocks to capture temporal dependencies across epochs in the sleep sequence. Each Transformer block consists of multi-head self-attention (MSA), feed-forward networks (FFN), and layer normalization (LN). (d) Padding and masking strategy implemented to handle samples with varying numbers of EEG channels, ensuring compatibility across different PSG datasets.

## Installation

We recommend using conda to create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n LPSGM python=3.10.9

conda activate LPSGM

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

If you only want to run inference on your own dataset without training, download our pre-trained weights from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eMuRaK4PelUAh9uG9DR2HXgExNmsoWhx?usp=sharing) and place them in the `weights/` directory.

Then modify the following parameters in `inference.py`:
- `edf_dir`: path to your EDF files
- `hypnogram_dir`: output path for hypnograms
- `channel_map_for_load_sig`: channel mapping based on your EDF channel names

**Important - Channel Mapping Configuration**: LPSGM uses 9 standard channels (F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, O2, E1, E2, Chin) and supports flexible configurations with 1-9 channels through a padding and masking mechanism. The `channel_map_for_load_sig` parameter maps these standard channel names to your EDF channel names. Two mapping types are supported: (1) **single channel mapping** for pre-referenced channels (e.g., `'C3': ('C3-M2',)`), and (2) **differential channel mapping** for computing differences between two electrodes (e.g., `'C3': (('C3', 'M2'),)`). Detailed configuration instructions with examples are provided in the comments above `channel_map_for_load_sig` in `inference.py`. Please read these instructions carefully to ensure correct channel mapping for your EDF files.

Run inference with:

```bash
python inference.py
```

**Note**: Running local inference requires at least one GPU. If you don't have a GPU available, we provide a web demo at [https://lpsgm.cpolar.top](https://lpsgm.cpolar.top). The complete code for the web demo is in the `web_demo/` directory. However, due to the large file size of full-night EEG recordings and network transmission limitations, we strongly recommend running inference locally.

## Real-time Inference

The original `inference.py` path is an offline full-night workflow: it builds all overlapping 20-epoch windows and votes over them. That means an epoch can benefit from future epochs in the same recording.

For real-time sleep staging, this repo includes `realtime_inference.py`. It loads LPSGM once, keeps a rolling buffer of the latest `seq_len` 30-second epochs, and returns the prediction for the newest epoch only.

### Replay a preprocessed recording epoch by epoch

```bash
python realtime_demo.py \
  --processed-npz sample_preprocessed.npz \
  --weights weights/ched32_seqed64_ch9_seql20_block6.pth \
  --output-csv realtime_predictions.csv
```

The NPZ file should contain one or more LPSGM channel arrays such as `C3`, `C4`, `E1`, `E2`, each shaped `(num_epochs, 3000)`.

### Replay an EDF as a real-time simulation

```bash
python realtime_demo.py \
  --edf subject.edf \
  --channel-map-json channel_map.json \
  --weights weights/ched32_seqed64_ch9_seql20_block6.pth \
  --output-csv realtime_predictions.csv
```

`channel_map.json` maps LPSGM channel names to EDF channel options. Differential channels are written as two-item arrays:

```json
{
  "C3": [["C3", "M2"], "C3-M2"],
  "C4": [["C4", "M1"], "C4-M1"],
  "E1": [["E1", "M2"], "LOC-M2"],
  "E2": [["E2", "M1"], "ROC-M1"]
}
```

### Use the Python API in a streaming system

```python
from realtime_inference import RealtimeLPSGMSleepStager

stager = RealtimeLPSGMSleepStager(
    weights="weights/ched32_seqed64_ch9_seql20_block6.pth",
    channel_order=["C3", "C4", "E1", "E2"],
    min_context=1,
)

# epoch is one newly completed 30-second epoch, already filtered,
# resampled to 100 Hz, normalized, and shaped as 3000 samples/channel.
prediction = stager.push_epoch({
    "C3": c3_epoch,
    "C4": c4_epoch,
    "E1": e1_epoch,
    "E2": e2_epoch,
})
print(prediction.stage, prediction.probabilities)
```

Set `min_context=20` if you prefer to suppress predictions until the rolling context is full. `RealtimePSGPreprocessor` and `RealtimeLPSGMPipeline` are also provided for causal chunk-based preprocessing of raw PSG samples before staging.

### Sleep-EDF Batch Real-time Test Results

We also evaluated the real-time causal pipeline on all publicly available Sleep-EDF Expanded sleep-cassette recordings. This is a local public-dataset validation of the real-time workflow, not the official LPSGM held-out test set.

Protocol:
- Dataset: Sleep-EDF Expanded v1.0.0, sleep-cassette subset
- Recordings: 153 full-night PSG recordings
- Files: 306 EDF files, PSG + hypnogram, SHA1 verified
- Epoch length: 30 seconds
- Context: current epoch plus up to 19 past epochs
- No future epochs and no offline full-night voting
- Weights: `weights/ched32_seqed64_ch9_seql20_block6.pth`

Sleep-EDF does not provide LPSGM's standard 9-channel montage, so the following engineering channel mapping was used:

| LPSGM channel | Sleep-EDF channel |
|---|---|
| C3 | EEG Fpz-Cz |
| O1 | EEG Pz-Oz |
| E1 | EOG horizontal |
| Chin | EMG submental |

Overall results:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Evaluated recordings | 153 / 153 |
| Evaluated epochs | 414,961 |
| Accuracy, all epochs | 79.35% |
| Accuracy, after 20-epoch warmup | 79.25% |
| Non-Wake accuracy | 56.99% |
| Balanced accuracy | 64.57% |
| Macro F1 | 0.5808 |
| Weighted F1 | 0.8157 |
| Cohen's kappa | 0.6186 |
| Total evaluation time | 2706.24 s |
| Mean evaluation time per epoch | 6.52 ms |
| Evaluation throughput | 153.33 epochs/s |

The full-recording accuracy is influenced by the large proportion of Wake epochs in Sleep-EDF. Balanced accuracy, Macro F1, and Non-Wake accuracy are more informative for judging sleep-stage performance. Because this test uses Sleep-EDF with an engineering channel mapping and a strictly causal real-time protocol, it should not be compared directly with the offline LPSGM paper results.

To reproduce the same evaluation after downloading Sleep-EDF sleep-cassette EDF files:

```bash
python tools/evaluate_sleepedf_batch_realtime.py \
  --data-dir /path/to/physionet-sleep-data \
  --weights weights/ched32_seqed64_ch9_seql20_block6.pth \
  --batch-size 64 \
  --device mps \
  --output-dir outputs/lpsgm_sleepedf_batch
```

## Fine-tuning for Sleep Staging

As demonstrated in our paper, large-scale hybrid pre-training significantly improves sleep staging performance on downstream datasets. We provide scripts and pre-trained models for fine-tuning on your specific dataset.

**Step 1**: Prepare your dataset following the preprocessing scripts in the `preprocess/` directory. Place the preprocessed data in the `data/` directory.

**Step 2**: Modify the `prepare_data` function in `finetune.py` to implement your custom data loading and splitting logic.

**Step 3**: Configure the parameters in `finetune.sh`, then run:

```bash
bash finetune.sh
```

### Sleep Disorder Diagnosis Dataset

| Dataset | Link |
|---------|------|
| MNC | [https://sleepdata.org/datasets/mnc](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/mnc) |

After downloading the datasets, run the preprocessing pipeline:

```bash
bash preprocess.sh
```

If some datasets are missing, comment out the corresponding commands in `preprocess.sh`.

## Training from Scratch

Configure the parameters in `train.sh`, then run:

```bash
bash train.sh
```

**Important**: To reduce memory overhead, the training process doesn't load all samples into memory. Instead, samples are cached in the directory specified by `--cache_root` and loaded dynamically during training. Make sure this directory has enough space to cache the segmented training samples (approximately 1TB as used in our paper).

## Screening for Sleep Disorders and Depression

As a downstream application of the pre-trained LPSGM encoder, we provide fine-tuning pipelines for narcolepsy, OSA severity, and depression classification. All three tasks share a unified two-stage protocol: backbone fine-tuning followed by frozen-backbone linear probing with a single class-weighted logistic regression. The shared implementation lives in `cls_core/`; task-specific data adapters and CLIs live in `nar_cls/`, `osa_cls/`, and `dep_cls/`. Per-fold outputs are written under `run_<task>/fold{N}/`.

### Narcolepsy (MNC, 3-class)

Classes: Non-narcolepsy Control / Type 1 Narcolepsy / Other Hypersomnia. Labels come from the `Diagnosis` field that the preprocessing scripts write into each subject NPZ.

```bash
for c in CNC DHC FHC IHC KHC SSC; do python preprocess/MNC/$c.py; done
bash nar_cls/run_nar.sh
```

### OSA Severity (APPLES, binary)

Classes: Severe vs Non-severe OSA (AHI-based). Labels in `preprocess/apples_osa_labels.csv` (included, 1100 subjects).

```bash
python preprocess/APPLES.py
bash osa_cls/run_osa.sh
```

### Depression (APPLES, binary)

Classes: Depressed vs Non-depressed. Labels in `preprocess/apples_dep_labels.csv` (included, 460 subjects; derivation criteria combine the self-reported `depressionmedhxhp` field with HAMD and BDI clinical scale scores).

```bash
python preprocess/APPLES.py          # skip if already preprocessed
bash dep_cls/run_dep.sh
```

## Grad-CAM Visualization

We provide a Grad-CAM + Guided Backpropagation pipeline for visualizing which PSG signal regions contribute most to LPSGM's sleep stage predictions. The code lives in the `gradcam/` directory and reuses the main `model/` module without duplication. The default configuration targets the MASS-SS1/SS3 datasets as a reproducible public-data example; other recordings can be supported by providing a new channel map in `gradcam/channel_maps.py` and, if the annotation format differs from EDF+, a matching annotation parser in `gradcam/utils.py`.

**Step 1**: Preprocess MASS-SS1/SS3 following `preprocess/MASS-SS1-SS3.py` so that subject-level EDF pairs (`{sub_id} PSG.edf` and `{sub_id} Base.edf`) are available under a source directory. Place the pretrained weights under `weights/`.

**Step 2**: Run the pipeline from the repository root:

```bash
python -m gradcam.pipeline \
    --src-root <path_to_mass_edf_root> \
    --weights weights/ched32_seqed64_ch9_seql20_block4.pth \
    --output-root gradcam_output \
    --stages save_raw,gradcam,guided,render
```

The pipeline runs four stages (`save_raw` / `gradcam` / `guided` / `render`); see `gradcam/README.md` for the per-stage walkthrough and the aggregation formula.
